# dev-times

Some say you should spend twice your time coding over learning.
Others, stressing more time coding, say 2.5 times. But if you're working
on a project, you can't really spend much time learning at all, even if
keeping up with the newest-latest is a nice idea. At that point, the
ratio needs to be even higher.

Since it's generally easier to estimate the total time you have in
the day to get things done than to figure your learning or coding
time and then run it through the ratio, this simple app does the
figuring for you based on total time.

If you're into Pomodoros, it'll round things out and give you that
info, too.

There's also something for those seeking a new job or for freelancers
(who *always* are seeking a new job). Your total time will be divided so
you can put in some hours submitting apps or writing proposals.

This app will be evolving.
